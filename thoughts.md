In order to be successful at Turing, it is important to learn by practicing and repetition.  Just understanding is not enough!
Another important tip for success at Turing is to become better at time management and build a living calendar.
I commit to practicing coding as much as I can during the rest of Mod 0.
I commit to reviewing my calendar on a regular basis and keeping it up to date.
Shout out to my partner Neeru for supporting me while I am attending Turing and serving me food during class :)
